//! Window layer (fork): always on top, normal, or pinned to the desktop.
//!
//! "On desktop" keeps the widget like a desktop gadget: below the other
//! windows, without a taskbar button (windowLayer.ts hides it), and still
//! there after Win+D. "Always on top" and "normal" are minimized by Win+D
//! like any window and come back with the second Win+D.
//!
//! The Win+D part is the owner trick desktop gadget tools use: a window
//! owned by the desktop window (`Progman`) is not hidden by "Show desktop"
//! and can never drop below its owner, so it stays visible and clickable
//! above the icons. Only for the desktop layer: tested with Win+D, an owned
//! topmost window was minimized anyway and lost topmost on the way back.
//!
//! "Below the other windows" is not tauri's always-on-bottom: that forces
//! the window to the bottom on every z-order change, and since an owned
//! window must stay above its owner it dragged the desktop down again each
//! time Win+D raised it, so "Show desktop" never happened. Instead the widget
//! is pushed to the bottom when it gets pinned and whenever another window
//! becomes the foreground window (`EVENT_SYSTEM_FOREGROUND`): that covers
//! clicking away from the widget and the second Win+D, which drops the
//! desktop but leaves the widget up among the windows. Nothing moves when
//! the desktop itself comes to the foreground (first Win+D) or while it is
//! shown — then a watcher thread waits, read-only, for it to drop (the
//! second Win+D raises no event) — or when the widget is in place already.
//! A timer that moved it every 2 s hit the moment Win+D raised the desktop
//! and pulled it down.
//!
//! Bringing a pinned widget up for a while (tray click, dragging) is
//! `raise_pinned`: a plain SetWindowPos(HWND_TOPMOST) from the command
//! thread. tauri's set_always_on_top goes through the main thread, which
//! Windows keeps busy in its own loop while a window is dragged, so the
//! widget only came up after the drag. For the same reason the end of a drag
//! is read from the mouse buttons (`raise_pinned_for_drag`), not from window
//! events.
